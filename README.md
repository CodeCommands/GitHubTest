# Salesforce Automated User Provisioning Demo Flow

## Pre-Demo Setup (2 minutes)

**Talking Points:**

- “Today I’ll show you how we’ve streamlined user provisioning across multiple applications in a single Salesforce org”
- “This solution eliminates manual user creation, reduces approval bottlenecks, and ensures consistent access management”
- “We’ll follow a complete user journey from request to activation”

-----

## Phase 1: End-User Experience (8-10 minutes)

### 1.1 Public Site - User Request Form (3-4 minutes)

**Demo Steps:**

1. Navigate to EITS Salesforce User Access Request page
1. Fill out the form with realistic DOE user data:
- First Name, Last Name
- DOE Email (show the @afs.com format)

1. Submit request

**Talking Points:**

- “DOE employees can access this self-service portal without needing a Salesforce license”
- “The form captures all DOE-specific information needed for compliance and provisioning”
- “Notice how the Application Role dropdown is dynamic - it shows only relevant roles based on the selected application”

## Phase 2: Internal Approval Process (8-10 minutes)

### 2.1 User Access Request Object (2-3 minutes)

**Demo Steps:**

1. Navigate to UAR records in Salesforce (show UAR-0010 or similar)
1. Show the comprehensive record with all captured data
1. Highlight the User Details section and status tracking
1. Point out the User Access Request History and Approval History panels

**Talking Points:**

- “Every request creates a comprehensive UAR record with a unique identifier like UAR-0010”
- “All DOE-specific information is captured: organization, application, role requirements”
- “The right panel shows complete audit trail - from submission to user creation”
- “Notice how the system tracks both the request progression AND the approval workflow”
- **Key Value:** “Complete traceability for compliance and audit requirements”

### 2.2 Approval Process in Action (3-4 minutes)

**Demo Steps:**

1. Show the approval queue/process triggered for a request like UAR-0007
1. Navigate to the approval interface (User Access Request Approval page)
1. Review request details as a “4BC User Access Approvers” team member
1. Show all the context: user info, requested application (4BC), specific role (Merit Reviewer Unrestricted)
1. Demonstrate the Approve/Reject decision
1. Show how the approval gets recorded in the Approval History

**Talking Points:**

- “Each application team (like 4BC) has their dedicated approver queue - no cross-team bottlenecks”
- “Approvers see complete context: DOE organization, specific role being requested, user details”
- “The approval routing is automatic - 4BC requests go to 4BC approvers, other apps to their respective teams”
- “Notice the clean interface showing exactly what access is being requested - no guesswork”
- **Key Value:** “Distributed approval process scales with DOE’s organizational structure”

### 2.3 Email Notifications (1 minute)

**Demo Steps:**

1. Show approval notification emails
1. Highlight different stakeholders receiving updates

**Talking Points:**

- “All stakeholders stay informed throughout the process”
- “Automated notifications eliminate manual communication”

-----

## Phase 3: Automated Provisioning (5-7 minutes)

### 3.1 Custom Metadata Configuration (2-3 minutes)

**Demo Steps:**

1. Navigate to Custom Metadata Types
1. Show Application and Persona configurations
1. Explain how these drive user creation

**Talking Points:**

- “This is where the magic happens - metadata-driven configuration”
- “Each application defines exactly what access users should receive”
- “Changes to access patterns don’t require code changes, just metadata updates”
- **Key Value:** “Flexible, maintainable configuration that business users can manage”

### 3.2 User Creation Process (2-3 minutes)

**Demo Steps:**

1. Show the completed UAR record (like UAR-0010) with “Completed” status

1. Demonstrate that the user was automatically created based on the approved request
1. Show assigned profile, role, permission sets based on the “4BC IRS Examiner” metadata configuration
1. Verify the Created User field links back to the actual Salesforce user

**Talking Points:**

- “Once approved, user creation is completely automated - no manual intervention”
- “The system created ‘PawanTest AUPUser’ with exactly the right access for 4BC IRS Examiner role”
- “Every user receives precisely the permissions defined in metadata - consistent and secure”
- “Notice the bidirectional linking - the UAR points to the created user for complete traceability”
- **Key Value:** “Zero-touch provisioning eliminates errors and ensures security compliance”
